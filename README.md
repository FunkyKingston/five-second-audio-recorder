# five-second-audio-recorder

This is a small project to get familiar with working with Audio data on the web. This React app allows a user to record a short audio clip and then play it back. 

In particular, the `MediaRecorder` interface of the MediaStream Recording API is used.

A next step for this project could be to play around with the Web Audio API to do things like processing, analyzing and/or visualizing the audio!
