# five-second-audio-recorder

This repository is my code for a recent code test. It was an interesting task, with some new aspects for me, as it was my first time working with Audio recording on the web. This small React app allows a user to record a short audio clip and then play it back, based on some very specific requirements of the particular code test!

In this implementation I use the `MediaRecorder` interface of the MediaStream Recording API.

A next step for this project could be to play around with the Web Audio API to do things like processing, analyzing and/or visualizing the audio!
